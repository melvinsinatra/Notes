## Signed vs Unsigned Integers

The difference is **whether a value can represent negative numbers**.

|Type|Can be negative?|Range usage|
|---|---|---|
|**Signed**|Yes|Half negative, half positive|
|**Unsigned**|No|All values are non-negative|
## Signed Integers

A **signed integer** reserves **one bit** to represent the sign.
- `0` → positive 
- `1` → negative

This is typically implemented using **[[Two’s complement]]**.
